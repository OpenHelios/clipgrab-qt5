This is a fork of ClibGrab for porting it to Qt5 by using the original 
sources from https://download.clipgrab.org/clipgrab-3.6.3.tar.gz

ï»¿Compiling ClipGrab is really easy.

You will only need the Qt4 or Qt5 developer libraries in order to compile
the program. In addition, ffmpeg (no developer libs necessary) needs to 
be installed.


To compile ClipGrab, simply execute
qmake clipgrab.pro && make

This will create an executable "clipgrab" that you can start via ./clipgrab.
